# Tech Quiz: GitHub Actions CI/CD Setup

## Description

Welcome to Tech Quiz. In this website, you can test your knowledge of the coding language Python. Simply start the quiz, click the answers you think are correct, and see how you did at the end. Once you're finished, you can even opt to take the quiz all over again!

While working on this project, I was able to practice proper quality checks as well as implement a CI/CD pipeline to ensure quality code is being deployed. This repo utilizes GitHub actions to run tests when pull requesting new code to update the development branch, as well as run tests and automatically deploy new code when creating a pull request to update the main branch.
